# Farming Simulator 2016

Description: This is an interactive farming simulator. There are four fields that you can plant crops on. There are five crops to choose from: corn, lettuce, potato, tomato, and wheat. You have to take care of these crops and make sure they don't die. You have to make sure to water your plants and remove weeds, because they will lower your crops' health.

Directions to compile/run: Open with processing. Click the play button!

Directions to use it: Click the start button. Then, click on the crops you want to plant. Take care of your crops, with the watering can and weed remover buttons. Once the height of your crop reaches 100 (or higher), you can harvest it using the harvest button (from which you gain money). On the right side, it shows you the stats of your crops. Make sure to pay attention to that. Watch out for the water level, because if it's too low for too long, your crop will lose health. Also, if it is ready to be harvested for too long, it will be worth less, so don't wait too long!
